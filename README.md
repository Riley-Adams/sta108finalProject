# sta108finalProject

In this project, which was a final project for a course at UC Davis called STA 108: Applied Statistical Methods - Regression Analysis, I used R 
to find a parsimonious model which predicts life expectancy. In order to meed this goal I took the following steps:

1. Built a model with LifeExpectancy as the outcome, and all remaining variables as predictors.

2. Carried out a residual analysis to identify
    * Deviations from linearity in any of the predictors
    * Possible transformations of predictors
    * Possible transformations fo the outcome variable.

3. Assessed the potential for multicollinearity.

4. Identified which variables are predictors of LifeExpectancy using model selection algorithms.
